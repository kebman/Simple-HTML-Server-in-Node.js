# Simple Static Web Server in Node.js
A simple example of a web server for static HTML files made with Node.js and Express.

It can receive and handle POST requests and serve some dynamic data. On the client side, a few simple AJAX calls are used to handle input and output. It's all very bare bones, and special emphasis is made to make the code easy to understand. Now just add your own features, and you have something presentable! :D

## Installation
Download the files. In the terminal, cd to the directory and input:

$ npm install

Then view the files on http://127.0.0.1:1338
